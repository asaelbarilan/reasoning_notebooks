# Reasoning Methods Exploration

This repository is designed to help users explore and understand various reasoning methods using AI models. Each notebook provides a hands-on example of a different reasoning strategy.

## Overview

- **Chain of Thought Reasoning**: Breaks down complex problems step by step.
- **Backward Reasoning**: Starts from a conclusion and works backward to find supporting premises.
- **Self-Consistency Reasoning**: Considers multiple perspectives and chooses the most consistent answer.
- **Defeasible Reasoning**: Revises conclusions when new information is introduced.
- **Commonsense Reasoning**: Uses common sense to determine the most plausible outcome.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebooks to explore different reasoning methods.
4. Use the provided code to experiment with your own tasks and datasets.
